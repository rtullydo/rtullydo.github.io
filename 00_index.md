I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo (where I also did my undergraduate degree). I work in operator theory, specifically in areas related to questions of complex analysis in one and several variables. <image align="right" src="858448641.jpg"/>

I'm very interested in open source materials for upper division mathematics. I've been making interactive notes for the last couple of years - you can find my work in the projects tab. All of that work is posted on github and free for use and modification.

I'm also working on efforts to organize the larger operator theory community - the Operator Theory Information Network is located at [operatortheory.org][1].
